Spring MVC
1. Spring MVC is used to create dynamic web pages
2. It uses three different components to implement the MVC design pattern
	a. Front Controller 
		1. implemented by the Dispatcher Servlet
		2. Dispatcher Servlet - handles the incoming requests from the user 
		3. We need to configure this dispatcher servlet in the config file
	b. Handler Mapper
		1. the DispatcherServlet uses the HandlerMapper (which uses the url
		   pattern to pass the user request to the correct controller) to 
		   invoke a controller
		2. The controller is a POJO class that we create that is marked with the
		   @Controller annotation
		3. The controller class will create a ModelAndView (model = data from the 
		   application, view=response page given back to user). Model is optional 
		   and dependent on if there's data to be sent back, view is mandatory 
		   since the end user has to see some response.
		4. We then return the ModelAndView to the DispatcherServlet, who then 
		   calls on the View Resolver
	c. View Resolver 
		1. The View Resolver takes the View name and appends to it a prefix and
		   and a suffix (prefix = location of the View file on the server, 
		   suffix = type of file for the View)
		2. The View Resolver than returns the view back to the DispatcherServlet
		   
		3. The DispatcherServlet takes the View, adds in the Model is there is 
		   any data to be added to the View, and sends the view back to the user

Creating a Spring MVC app (5 steps):
1. Configure dispatcher servlet
2. Configure spring config file
3. Configure the View Resolver 
4. Create the controller
5. Create the folder structure and view (jsp page under Web-Inf)
