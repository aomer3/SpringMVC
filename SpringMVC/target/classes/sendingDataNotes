Sending Data from Controller to UI
1. We send data from the controller to the UI using the ModelAndView object
2. We set data into the ModelAndView object using addObject(key,value) method,
   where key is a String and value is an Object
3. Once the data is set and the response goes back to the UI, we can access 
   the ModelAndView object using the request.getAttribute("key") method from 
   the servlet pages 
4. We can set anything into the ModelAndView object from primitives, to objects
   to even collections

Sending Data from the UI to the Controller
1. Data can be sent from the UI to the Controller in two ways 
	a. using a HTML form
		1. When we send data from the HTML form, we can access that data from the 
		   controller as an object 
		2. For this process to work, we must first create a object that will hold the
		   data being received from the HTML form (the number of object fields should 
		   match the number of HTML fields, and the field names should match also).
		3. To read the data from the the HTML forms in the controller, we use the 
		   @ModelAttribute annotation on the controller methods reading the data 
	b. using query parameters  
		1. Data is sent using ?key=value&key=value method 
		2. Once data is sent from UI to controller, @ReqeustParamter("key") DT 
		   could then be used to retrieve the data and set it into the variable 
		   ex: @RequestParem("id") int id
