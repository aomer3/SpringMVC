ModelMap
1. This is an alternative to using ModelAndView object to receive and send data 
   between the JSP view pages and the controller 
2. ModelMap came in later iterations of Java after ModelAndView object and it was 
   made to avoid the tight coupling of ModelAndView object. ModelMap makes it so 
   you can deal with the model separately, and the view separately. This makes it 
   possible to just create a view, in the case that there is no data to return instead
   of creating a ModelAndView object every time. 
3. The ModelMap is a map that holds key-value pairs, and data can be set to the model
   by using addAttribute(key, value)
4. The View is a String
